            Opera is an art form that celebrates the human voice at its highest
            level of expression. No other art form creates excitement and moves
            the heart in the way that opera does, especially when performed by a
            great singer. Such singers are trained to present some of the
            greatest and most challenging music that has ever been composed for
            the human voice.

            Opera is an important part of the Western classical music tradition.
            It uses music, words, and actions to bring a dramatic story to life.
            Opera started in Italy at the end of the 16th century and later
            became popular throughout Europe. Over the years, it has responded
            to various musical and theatrical developments around the world and
            continues to do so. In recent decades, much wider audiences have
            been introduced to opera through modern recording technology. Some
            singers have become celebrities thanks to performing on radio, on
            television, and in the cinema.

            However, in recent years, opera has been facing serious challenges.
            The causes of some of these are beyond its control. One current
            challenge to opera is economic. The current world economic slowdown
            has meant that less money is available for cultural institutions and
            artists. This shortage of money raises the broader question of how
            much should be paid to support opera singers and other artists.
            Society seems to accept the large salaries paid to business managers
            and the multi-million-dollar contracts given to sports athletes.{" "}
            <span className="underline">But what about opera singers?</span>{" "}
            Somehow, people have the idea that artists can be creative only if
            they suffer in poverty, but this is unrealistic: If artists,
            including opera singers, lack the support they need, valuable talent
            is wasted.

          <div className="flex-grow">
            Not only the shortage of money, but also the way money is managed in
            the opera world has led to hardships. Principal singers are
            generally paid performance fees once they complete a show. They
            typically receive nothing during the many weeks of rehearsal before
            a show starts. To prepare for a role, they must pay the costs of
            lessons and coaching sessions. If they become ill or cancel their
            performance, they lose their performance fee. The insecurity of this
            system puts the future of opera at risk.

          <div className="flex-grow">
            Another problem faced by opera is how to meet the demands of
            audiences who are influenced by popular entertainment. Pop singers
            are often judged as much on the basis of how they look as how they
            sound. Therefore, opera singers, performing to audiences influenced
            by this popular culture, are now expected to be &quot;models who
            sing.&quot; These demands may be unrealistic and possibly harmful.
            Opera singers simply cannot make a sound big enough to fill a large
            theater or concert hall without a microphone if their body weight is
            too low. Emphasizing physical appearance over singing ability may
            cause audiences to miss out on the human voice at its best.

            There are no easy solutions to opera's problems and there are many
            different opinions about the value of opera. However, every year
            many young people register for music courses with hopes and dreams
            of developing their talents in this special art form. The fact that
            opera has survived many obstacles and continues to attract the
            rising generation demonstrates that it remains a respected art form
            full of value.
