              Hello, everyone. I&apos;m Sarah King, an exchange student from
              London. I&apos;d like to share something important with you today.
              {Kaisetsu(showResults, "21-3B-1")}

              You may have heard of the Sakura International Centre. It provides
              valuable opportunities for Japanese and foreign residents to get
              to know each other. Popular events such as cooking classes and
              karaoke contests are held every month. However, there is a serious
              problem. The building is getting old, and requires expensive
              repairs. To help raise funds to maintain the centre, many
              volunteers are needed.
              {Kaisetsu(showResults, "21-3B-2")}
            </p>

            <p className="indent-7">
              I learnt about the problem a few months ago. While shopping in
              town, I saw some people taking part in a fund-raising campaign. I
              spoke to the leader of the campaign, Katy, who explained the
              situation. She thanked me when I donated some money. She told me
              that they had asked the town mayor for financial assistance, but
              their request had been rejected. They had no choice but to start
              fund-raising.
              {Kaisetsu(showResults, "21-3B-3")}
            </p>

            <p className="indent-7">
              Last month, I attended a lecture on art at the centre. Again, I
              saw people trying to raise money, and I decided to help. They were
              happy when I joined them in asking passers-by for donations. We
              tried hard, but there were too few of us to collect much money.
              With a tearful face, Katy told me that they wouldn&apos;t be able
              to use the building much longer. I felt the need to do something
              more. Then, the idea came to me that other students might be
              willing to help. Katy was delighted to hear this.

            <p className="indent-7">
              Now, I&apos;m asking you to join me in the fund-raising campaign
              to help the Sakura International Centre. Please email me today! As
              an exchange student, my time in Japan is limited, but I want to
              make the most of it. By working together, we can really make a
              difference.
