              Sure. If a new factory is built here, more people will move to our
              town. This would help local shops and restaurants because there
              would be more customers. Also, some of our residents working in
              the next town could find jobs here. Many people have complained
              about their long drive back and forth to work. Working closer to
              home would improve their family life by giving them more time to
              spend together.

              Well, I think it would be better to build a shopping mall. It
              would be good for both customers and shop owners. When the new
              housing complex is completed in the northeastern part of town,
              people living there would be pleased with a nearby mall to shop
              at. Lots of my fellow merchants have been wishing they could move
              to a new place. Such a mall would be a benefit to shop owners
              because more people would visit their shops.

          <div>
            <p>
              I agree. A mall would also be useful for people in other parts of
              town because they could do all of their shopping at one place. It
              would save everyone time, and families would enjoy their lives
              more. And the highway exit is in the same area. So, not only would
              people in our town shop at a mall built there but people from
              other towns would also have easy access to it. That would increase
              our local businesses' profits.

          <span className="font-bold mr-5">Carol:</span>
          <span>
            Right. It would make family life here much better as well as bring
            more customers to our town.

            So, you both feel that a mall would help

            <p>
              I don't think building a mall or opening a business is the only
              way to help our economy grow. We should find ways of using the
              beauty of nature, which our town is already famous for. It makes
              our town a nice place for families to live in.

            <p>
              I think so, too. We should try to develop without changing the
              things that families living here and visitors enjoy. Using the
              beautiful scenery of our town in more creative ways would
              encourage people to come and live here. That would bring more
              money into our town.

            <p>
              I completely agree. In the long run, our town will be hurt if its
              natural surroundings are not preserved.

              So, Leslie and Ellen are talking about the importance of
              maintaining the natural features of our town. Well, from our
              discussion so far, it seems everyone thinks, when developing our
              town, we should
