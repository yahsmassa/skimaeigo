            Most students come to my school by bus or train. I often see a lot
            of students playing games on their phones or chatting. However, they
            could also use this time for reading or doing homework. We started
            this activity to help students use their commuting time more
            effectively.

            Students had to complete a commuting activity chart from January
            17th to February 17th. A total of 300 students participated: More
            than two thirds of them were second-years; about a quarter were
            third-years; only 15 first-years participated. How come so few
            first-years participated? Based on the feedback (given below), there
            seems to be an answer to this question:
