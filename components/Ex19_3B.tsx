                  Thanks for coming in on a Saturday, everyone. It wasn't easy
                  to find a time for us all to sit down and talk. As you know,
                  Ms. Guillot is retiring this year. It is our responsibility to
                  arrange a gift for her on behalf of all current and former
                  students. We don't have much time before her party, so I'd
                  really like to reach a final decision today. Did you come up
                  with any ideas?

                  Not exactly, but I've heard that many teachers get bored after
                  retirement. I don't think we should get her something like a
                  painting, because it would just sit on the wall. If we buy her
                  something that she can make the most of on a daily basis, then
                  she will feel the appreciation all her students have for her
                  more often.

                  I don't think Ms. Guillot will be bored in her retirement. We
                  all know that she is very active. She often participates in
                  sporting events and loves spending time outside. I heard that
                  on Saturdays and Sundays, she runs in the mornings and plays
                  tennis in the evenings. She hardly ever stays indoors and
                  never misses her daily walk even if it is raining.

                  And, she loves doing work in her garden, too. I've seen some
                  pictures of her house. She has a beautiful garden and a
                  massive deck. She has a great variety of flowers and
                  vegetables. She often spends time relaxing on her deck just
                  enjoying the view of her garden.

                  Why don't we get her something she can use for entertaining
                  people? Ms. Guillot loves cooking and I heard she has small
                  parties at her house every couple of weeks. Hmm..., I don't
                  think we need to get her anything to use in the kitchen, as
                  she seems to have plenty of that kind of stuff already. And
                  usually, people who like cooking have their own preferences
                  when it comes have their own preferences when it comes to
                  things like that.

                  I agree. She's told us about her parties. She often mentions
                  that whenever she has them, everyone has to go inside to eat
                  if they want to sit down. Perhaps something that she can use
                  when entertaining her guests would be most appropriate.

                  I think that's a great point. Once she has retired, I'm sure
                  she'll be having more of those parties. Who knows? Maybe
