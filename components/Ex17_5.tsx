        <p className="ml-6 mb-6">Ahhhhhhhhhh!</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          With a big yawn I woke up. What a fresh morning! I felt very sharp,
          much sharper than usual. I was able to hear the singing of birds more
          clearly than ever before. I noticed the smell of coffee coming up from
          downstairs. I stretched out my arms in front of myself and raised my
          back; it felt so good. I sat up straight, licked my hand, and started
          to clean my face with it....
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Huh?... Something was strange. Why was I licking my hand with my
          tongue? Why was my body covered with fur? I tried to say something,
          but the sound that came out of my mouth was... &quot;Meow.&quot;
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It was certainly my bedroom that I was in. It was certainly my bed
          that I was sitting on. Everything was as usual except that... I seemed
          to have changed into a different creature. I was so surprised that I
          couldn&apos;t move. I couldn&apos;t do anything. I wondered — would I
          have to spend the rest of my life as an animal? I began to feel
          afraid.... But after a few moments those feelings passed. So, with a
          wave of my tail, I started to explore my surroundings. A cat&apos;s
          mind is said to be changeable like that.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As I went down the stairs, the smell of coffee grew stronger and I
          could tell what was for breakfast. Maybe the senses of a cat are
          sharper than those of a human. When I got to the dining room, what I
          saw almost stopped my heart. It was <em>me</em>! The human <em>I</em>{" "}
          was sitting at the dining table! I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off{" "}
          <em>myself</em>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The human <em>I</em> was absorbed in a smartphone, maybe writing
          responses to friends&apos; messages or playing an online game. Bending{" "}
          <em>my</em> head down toward the phone, <em>I</em> was sitting with
          rounded shoulders and a curved back. <em>I</em> looked very
          uncomfortable.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <em>I</em> sometimes took a little bite of toast, but it appeared that{" "}
          <em>I</em> was not noticing any taste in <em>my</em> mouth. Actually,
          the taste of toast in my memory was vague. I couldn&apos;t remember
          what else had been served for breakfast recently, either. The human{" "}
          <em>I</em> was just mindlessly putting in <em>my</em> mouth anything
          that was on the plate while handling the phone. <em>I</em> was so
          focused on the text messages or games that <em>I</em> took little
          interest in what was happening around
          <em>me</em>. In fact, <em>my</em> face had no expression on it at all.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          &quot;Yuji, you never study these days. Are you ready for your final
          exams? You&apos;re making me a little bit worried,&quot; said Mom.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          &quot;Mmm,&quot; said <em>I</em>. A sign of frustration briefly
          appeared on <em>my</em> face, but it disappeared in an instant.{" "}
          <em>My</em> face was again as expressionless as it had been before.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <span className="underline">
            &quot;I don&apos;t like this guy,&quot;
          </span>{" "}
          I thought. But this guy was me. I couldn&apos;t deny it. For the first
          time, I realized how I really looked to other people.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Then, as <em>I</em> started to leave the table, our eyes met.
          &quot;Wow! Mom, look! There&apos;s a cat in the dining room!&quot;
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          I didn&apos;t know why, but I was running. I felt I had to escape.
          Running up the stairs, I found the window in my room was open. I
          jumped! I had a strange feeling. The world suddenly seemed to have
          shifted. I felt my body falling down and....
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">Bump!</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          I was awake, lying on the floor of my room. I slowly sat up and looked
          around. Everything looked like it usually did. I looked at my hands. I
          was relieved to see they were no longer covered with fur. I stood up
          and, with a yawn, extended my arms above my head to stretch my back.
          Without thinking, as was my usual habit in the morning, I started to
          walk to my desk where my smartphone had completed charging and... I
          stopped.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After pausing for a moment, I turned around and went downstairs for
          breakfast.
