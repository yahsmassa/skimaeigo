            Good morning. I'm sure everyone did the homework reading, so I want
            to begin today's class on intercultural communication. My first
            question is "Why do we need to study intercultural communication?"
            Would anyone like to answer?

          <p className="text-base">
            Yes, I'll try to answer that. People may think the way they do
            things or the way they view the world is "natural" and "correct."
            When they encounter someone doing things differently, they regard it
            as "strange" or "wrong." Having an awareness of intercultural
            communication can help us understand and deal with misunderstandings
            when they arise. I think it is especially important these days
            because people travel overseas for many reasons, such as work,
            study, or vacations. The opportunities to meet people from other
            countries have increased greatly. With this increased contact, there
            are more chances for trouble between people from different cultures.

            Let's move on to the concept of "culture." You should know that
            because culture is all around us all the time, it is difficult to
            define. Therefore, we tend to discuss culture in terms of
            characteristics. Can anyone give an example of a cultural
            characteristic?

            The characteristic I found interesting is that people belonging to a
            culture have the same values, beliefs, and behaviors. Values are
            things that are felt to be of worth, like the Japanese concept of
            "mottainai." Beliefs are things that people believe to be true, and
            these cover a wide variety of areas. For example, people in a
            culture might share beliefs about the kinds of foods that are
            unacceptable. Behavior is about people's actions, and people in the
            same culture can often be seen behaving similarly.

            What about people who always seem to be different from those around
            them? Sometimes I don't do things in the same way as my friends. So,
            if we need to have the same behavior for group membership, does that
            mean those who are not the same aren't members of their cultural
