              For most people, their friendships are a valuable and important
              part of who they are. Psychologists have pointed out that
              well-established friendships lead us to a better understanding of
              ourselves. They have also noted that we might face conflicts not
              only with acquaintances but even with our good friends, which
              could result in ends to some of our friendships. Fortunately, even
              when such conflicts occur, it is possible to find ways to maintain
              or save the friendships.

              One way to help save a friendship in trouble is to keep in touch.
              When we think a friend has done something that hurt our feelings,
              our first response may be to cut off contact. However, it may be
              better to <span className="underline">swallow our pride</span> and
              avoid doing that. For example, Mary watched her friend
              Susan&apos;s children every week until Susan finished night school
              and graduated. But after that, Mary did not hear from Susan for
              several months. So, she felt that Susan had been just using her.
              She decided not to talk to her any more. In the end, however, Mary
              forced herself to ignore her own feelings and told Susan about her
              disappointment. Susan immediately apologized and told her that she
              had been just trying to catch up with things after completing her
              studies. Susan would never have known there was a problem if Mary
              had not mentioned it. Not cutting off contact, even when we may be
              angry, is very important for maintaining good relationships.

              Another way to help a friendship is to see things from our
              friend&apos;s point of view. For example, Mark was very upset at
              his good friend, Kate, because she had not visited him in the
              hospital. Later, he learned from Kate&apos;s friend that she had
              been afraid of hospitals ever since she had been hospitalized as a
              little girl for a serious illness. Mark then understood why Kate
              hadn&apos;t come and, instead of being angry, he felt sympathy for
              her.

            <p className="text-justify">
              An important part of dealing with friendships is to recognize and
              accept that they can change as our needs and lifestyles evolve.
              For example, we may have a good friend in high school, but once we
              graduate, move to a different city for work or study, or get
              married, we may see that friend less frequently and our feelings
              may change. In other words, sometimes a close friendship may alter
              in nature. We should keep in mind that we may still be friends but
              not in the same way as before.

          <div className="flex-grow">
            <p className="text-justify">
              How do people keep friendships for a long time? In one study,
              researchers interviewed many people who had been friends for a
              long time in order to find out the secret. They found that those
              people kept small misunderstandings from growing into large
              disputes which might cause their friendships to end. By taking
              their friends&apos; viewpoints and not being afraid to express
              their honest feelings, those who were interviewed were able to
              keep something minor from growing into a major argument.

              We all know that friendships are precious, but we also understand
              that friendships are not always stable. The challenge in
              maintaining friendships is keeping the connections strong during
              the ups and downs that happen in all relationships. When things
              are going well, we enjoy our friendships. If things go bad, we
              should remember the points above. Sometimes we can get the
              relationship back on track, but at other times we should accept
              and appreciate that relationships can change. However, regardless
              of the states of our friendships, they will continue to be an
              important part of our lives.
